    <h1>Our Story</h1>

    <p class="indent">
      Ellen was garage sale hunting with her mom around College Hill Park, on a mission to find nothing she needed but
      everything that no one wants. Eric was in the same park showing his parents from Boston around, walking with his
      3-month-old chic magnet… er, uh puppy, named Glacier. The mission for a sweet deal stopped abruptly when Ellen’s
      mom spotted an adorable fluff ball, a baby Siberian Husky. Ellen and her mom started fawning from afar when mama
      Healy stated, “Let’s say hi. We gotta see that puppy!” Ellen begged, “Mom, please no… Let’s let them enjoy their
      walk,” A bit too shy to interrupt, plus, she thought the boy was cute.</p>

      <p class="indent">“Nope!” Mama Healy said, dragging Ellen through the 200 yards of grass towards the nice family enjoying their
      peace. Reaching Eric and his family, Ellen’s mom exclaimed, “What a cute dog! I hope you don’t mind, but we just
      gotta see your dog up close!” Eric was understandably startled by their entrance but seeing this girl laugh with
      her mom as they beelined across the park, he was more than okay with the situation. Plus, he thought the girl was
      cute. He politely stopped walking with his folks to let Ellen and her mother greet his dog. “What’s his name?”
      Ellen asked, wishing she had worn something better than her sweats. “Glacier,” Eric said, smiling and trying to
      find her eyes. “That’s a great name,” she said, smiling and finding his.</p>

      <p class="indent">What started off as small talk led to a much longer conversation. The parents got along on day one. Not a bad
      start, eh?
      “So, what do you do?” “How long have you been in Wichita?” “Can we have the dog?” Learning that they both lived in
      College Hill, the meet-cute ended by exchanging names and saying “see ya later” with earnest hopes to do so. That
      evening, Ellen’s mom laid on the pressure, encouraging Ellen to reach out and make Eric her new friend. Ellen had
      a good feeling about Eric, so she reached out on Facebook and invited him to Trivia. Eric came, and they both
      conquered, or did they?</p>

      <p class="indent">The couple to this day don’t remember the result of the trivia game, only recall failing to do their part in
      helping with every question, a bit too distracted getting to know one another, missing the prompts, and not really
      caring. From that day forward, Eric and Ellen were attached to the hip. It started slow but soon became an
      everyday kind of thing. The convenience of living a mile away made the choice easy when choosing who to hang out
      with, but the unexplainable pull towards one another made it so more than just convenience. You best believe that
      if the pair lived an hour away, they’d make the time. These friends who started as just people with similar
      interests soon became best friends with inside jokes and stolen looks. Their friendship took them through many
      firsts. From EDM festivals to skydiving, Eric and Ellen continued to live their best life and face all their
      fears, not alone but together. It soon became crystal clear to them and to everyone else for that matter that
      there was something more, something well beyond friendship there. As time went on, strong feelings grew, courage
      was built, and the first of many “I love you’s” slipped. Three years later, proclaimed by both Eric and Ellen as
      the best years of their lives, Eric popped the important question in College Hill Park, where they first met by
      the same tree with the same chic-magnet puppy, now their dog, Glacier.</p>

      <p class="indent">Eric and Ellen are delighted to invite you to their wedding, where you’ll witness their friendship, their
      happiness, and the love they share for one another. Please join us in celebrating their blessed union.
